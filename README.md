## Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy the Odoo Simplified Setup:

### **Requirements**

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
- **Basic Command-Line Knowledge**: Familiarity with running scripts and Docker commands.

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenSrc-NeuralInverse/Odoo-Simplified-Setup.git
cd Odoo-Simplified-Setup
```

### **Step 2: Configure the Environment**

1. Rename the provided `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   mv .env.example .env
   ```

2. Customize the `.env` file as needed. Default values are provided:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
   POSTGRES_DB=postgres
   ODOO_DB_USER=odoo
   ODOO_DB_PASSWORD=odoo
   ODOO_PORT=8069
   ADMINER_PORT=8080
   ```

3. Update variables in the `build_and_run.sh` or `build_and_run.bat` scripts if necessary.

### **Step 3: Deploy the Setup**

#### For Linux/Mac:

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./build_and_run.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./build_and_run.sh
   ```

#### For Windows:

1. Execute the batch script:
   ```
   build_and_run.bat
   ```

## Customization Options

You can modify the following parameters in the `.env` file:

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`
- **Odoo**:
  - `ODOO_PORT`, `ODOO_DB_USER`, `ODOO_DB_PASSWORD`
- **Adminer**:
  - `ADMINER_PORT`

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker Not Running**: Ensure Docker is installed and running before deploying.
- **Port Conflicts**: Check that the ports in `.env` are not in use by other applications.
- **Container Logs**: Use `docker-compose logs` to debug issues.
- **Connection Errors**: Verify database credentials and configurations in the `.env` file.

---

## Project Structure

- `build_and_run.sh`: Shell script for Linux/Mac setup.
- `build_and_run.bat`: Batch script for Windows setup.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for all services.
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables.
- `README.md`: Quick setup guide.
